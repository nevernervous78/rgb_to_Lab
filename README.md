# rgb_to_Lab
Python script implementing the conversion between RGB colour space and La*b* colour space.

It specifically accepts RGBC data as produced by the Adafruit [TCS34725 RGB Color Sensor Module](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-color-sensors/overview), but it can be modified to accept conventional RGB values.
