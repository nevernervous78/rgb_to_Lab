# rgb_to_Lab
Python script implementing the conversion between RGB colour space and Lab colour space.

It specifically accepts RGBC data as produced by the Adafruit [TCS34725 RGB Color Sensor Module](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-color-sensors/overview), but it can be modified to accept conventional RGB values.

The maths behind the matrix conversion is explained at [this site](http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_RGB_XYZ_Matrix.html) and on Wikipedia at [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space).
